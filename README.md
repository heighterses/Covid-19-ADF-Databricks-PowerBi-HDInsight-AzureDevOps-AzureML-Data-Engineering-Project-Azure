## 👷🏻‍♂️ Data Engineering Project - End-to-End Automated Pipeline

This project showcases a **fully automated data engineering pipeline** using various Azure services. It covers the entire data lifecycle from **ingestion** to **transformation** and **presentation**, including:

- **💡 Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Orchestrates the data pipeline, automating data ingestion from multiple sources.
- **⚡ Databricks**: Performs large-scale data transformation using PySpark and Delta Lake, creating a clean and structured dataset.
- **📊 Power BI**: Visualizes the transformed data for business insights and reporting.
- **🔧 Azure DevOps**: Manages CI/CD pipelines for seamless integration and deployment of the project.
- **🤖 Azure Machine Learning (ML)**: Implements machine learning models to derive predictive insights from the data.
- **📈 Azure HDInsight**: Processes large datasets for scalable, distributed data handling.
- **🔐 Azure Key Vault**: Secures storage and management of secrets, such as API keys and connection strings.

This **automated pipeline** ensures efficient data processing, transformation, and presentation in a **secure** and **scalable environment**. The project highlights a modern approach to data engineering, leveraging **cloud-native services** to deliver data-driven insights.
